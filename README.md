# Hanja WordPress Plugin

This plugin embeds the Hanja Proficiency Test React application into WordPress. Use the `[hanja_test]` shortcode to display the test and `[hanja_register]` to display a login/register form.

Test results are saved to user meta and can be viewed under **Hanja Results** in the admin menu.
